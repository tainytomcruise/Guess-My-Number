This is a fun and interactive game. It requires the user to guess a number between the given range and within the alloted turns. If you you guess the number within the limited chance you win else you lose.

The project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This project is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy.

HAPPY CODING!!!
